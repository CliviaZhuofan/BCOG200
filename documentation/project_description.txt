Project Description: Toss Game
Overview:
"Toss Game" is an individual game developed using Python's Pygame library. The game challenges players to control a ball that moves horizontally across the top of the screen and can be dropped vertically by clicking the mouse. The primary objective is to hit randomly placed, colorful boxes at the bottom of the screen to score points. Each box hit adds to the player's score, which is determined by the box's position and inherent value.

Features:

Dynamic Start Screen: Before entering the game, players are greeted with a start screen that displays the game's title and a start button. This screen also provides instructions on how to play the game, informing players to "Click the mouse to control the ball and try to get the highest score."

Interactive Gameplay: Players initiate the ball's movement by clicking the mouse. The game is designed to test players' timing and precision as they aim to drop the ball onto target boxes.

Scoring System: Each box has a unique point value based on its position. The further the box from the starting point, the higher the potential score, challenging players to make precise drops for maximum points.

Visual Feedback: The game uses a variety of colors for the boxes to enhance the gaming experience, providing immediate feedback on actions taken.

Game Mechanics:

The ball moves horizontally and changes direction upon hitting the screen edges.
Gravity affects the ball's vertical drop once it leaves the horizontal path.
The game tracks and displays the current score and the number of balls remaining. The session ends when all balls have been used.
Modular Code Structure: The game's codebase is modular, with separate Python modules for handling different aspects of the game:

box_utils.py handles the random placement of scoring boxes.
start_screen.py manages the initial start screen, enhancing maintainability and readability of the code.
Goal:
The main goal of "Toss Game" is to provide a possible
