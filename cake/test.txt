Cake Stepping Game Infinite Mode Test
Description
This test verifies the functionality of the Infinite Mode in your Cake Stepping Game. We’ll simulate the game loop, girl’s movement, and scoring to ensure everything works as expected.

Steps to Run the Test
Initialize the Game:
Start the game in Infinite Mode.
Set up the girl character and the initial cake positions.
Simulate Game Loop:
Continuously simulate the game loop (you can use a timer or a loop with a delay).
In each iteration:
Randomly generate mouse click events (left or right).
Call move_girl_character() with the mouse click event.
Update the girl’s position based on the click.
Check if the girl has fallen off the cake using check_game_over().
If the game is over, end the loop.
Scoring Points:
After each successful landing on a cake, call calculate_points() with the girl’s position (left, middle, or right).
Adjust the player’s score accordingly.
End the Game:
When the girl falls off the cake, display the final score.
Confirm that the game ends as expected.
