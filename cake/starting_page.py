# Functions to implement:
# - create_cake(): Create a new cake with random position (left or right)
# - cake.move(speed): Move the cake horizontally
# - mouse_clicked(): Check if the mouse was clicked
# - find_clicked_cake(): Find the cake that was clicked
# - stop_cake(cake): Stop the cake's movement
# - render_game(): Draw cakes, score, and other game elements
